# ethology-simulation

This game/simulation was used to test the principle of natural selection, as part of a laboration in Experimental Ethology.

The participants of the study were told to click as many insects as possible during a set period of time, and after every few seconds the insects produced off-springs. The insects were colored randomly (from a set of predefined colors) and each off-spring had the same color as its parent. After a few "generations", the population of insects that had the most similar color to the background were the most populous.

The simulation was made using Unity and C#.
